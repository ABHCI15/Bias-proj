        ## ü§î  Think Before You Scroll: Social Media's Impact

        Before you answer, quickly consider how excessive social media, especially doomscrolling and short-form content, might affect you.

        ---

        ### üì± What is Doomscrolling?

        **Doomscrolling** is the act of compulsively scrolling through negative news or social media content, even when it's upsetting.

        *   **Mental Health:**
            *   Increased anxiety, stress, and mood swings.
            *   Sleep disruption.


        *   **Cognitive Effects:**
            *   Reduced attention span.
            *   Information overload and distraction.


        *   **Social Impacts:**
            *   Feelings of comparison, envy, and social isolation.
            *   Exposure to echo chambers and increased polarization.
